          <h3 class="about__content_title">Introducing 1clickDAO.com</h3>
          <p class="mt">1. Personalised DAO covering 99% of your needs in 1 click</p>
          <p>2. Manage assets across DeFi and NFT ecosystems on any chain</p>
          <p>3. 24/7 on-chain transparency, 100% control via voting, ‘rage quit’ at any time, historical on chain asset performance in $/BTC/BNB/ETH vs virtual irrelevant APY %</p>
          <p class="mt">Stacks and platforms used: The Graph, Aragon, Zerion, ….</p>
          <p class="mt">If you are managing assets in traditional world - you open a fund … with a proper legal entity, licenses, costly fund administrators, regular legal fees, audits, etc. 
      Cost, legal complexity and regular changing rules are of a big issue</p>
          <p class="mt">If you are managing crypto assets - most likely you will depend on the goodwill of the traders who would receive funds from you on their personal crypto exchange accounts or simple wallets.   
      What if they run away with your money or sudden health incidents occur?</p>
          <p class="mt">DeFi ecosystem managed by DAO-interfaces provide a phenomenal combination of security, transparency, flexibility and cost-efficiency to asset managers and their clients.</p>
          <p class="mt">There are however a few limitations:</p>
          <p>4. Current DAO platforms are either (i) too complex for regular asset managers and their client to deploy, tune in and operate; or (ii) too limited in functionality for a typical asset management task as they are often built with little industry expertise </p>
          <p>5. With ever growing gas fees on Ethereum it is becoming costly to service small-ticket clients and use new DeFi solutions which are just starting with low AUM (assets under management)</p>
          <p class="mt">Hence, (a) moving the proven solutions from Ethereum to more user-friendly and cost-effective networks, and (b) simplifying the DAO user experience - is the task for 1clickDAO.com (http://1clickdao.com/) </p>
          <p class="mt">Imagine a combination of Tilda, Aragon, Furucombo, and Zerion - all deployed in 1 click and managed across the major Layer 1 and 2 blockchains! </p>
          <p class="mt">This is what we are building with 1clickDAO.io (http://1clickdao.io/) </p>
          <p>Berezka DAO + BIAlliance (Blockchain Industrial Alliance) have joined forces to create something fascinating.</p>
          <p class="mt">With Berezka DAO we have already launched and are managing a range of DAOs since mid-2019 with sustainably pleasant APY and ever growing AUM.</p>
          <p>With BI Alliance team we have already launched a template DAO Constructor that launches the mostly used DAO structure for any asset manager on Ethereum.</p>
          <p class="mt">Now within the framework of the BSC Hackathon we will move our working DAO Constructor to Binance Smart Chain and introduce very handy interfaces for asset managers:</p>
          <p class="mt">6. Deploy your personal DAO in 1 click</p>
          <p>7. Create your unique DAO name, token names and tickers, voting rules - get a freshly baked DAO in a manner of minutes with one click (easier than opening an LLC in any country)</p>
          <p>8. Allow your LPs (Limited Partners, or investors/contributors) to easily Deposit/Withdraw funds, tack performance over historical data indexed by Graph, see their actual real-time ROI in actual USD, not hypothetical APY, allow ‘instant rage quit’ to avoid DAO managers’ misconduct</p>
          <p>9. Handy interface for GPs (General Partners or DAO managers, who have voting rights) allowing to easily switch between DAOs; initiate voting, vote and keep track of all historical voting; initiate asset allocation/relocation via one interface</p>
          <p class="mt">Benefits and other cool features (at different stages of development):</p>
          <p class="mt">⁃ Immediate and cheap rollout and management</p>
          <p>⁃ Individual token names </p>
          <p>⁃ Personalised front end</p>
          <p>⁃ Automated analytics and charts on all activity and individual member performance (The Graph, Zerion) </p>
          <p>⁃ Real-time calculation and traction of GPs’ ‘success fees’</p>
          <p>⁃ Real-time online verification of AUM on DAO’s wallets (Zerion, Debank)</p>
          <p>⁃ Active management of whitelisted DeFi resources via voting (Snapshot)</p>
          <p>⁃ Automated asset allocation strategies flexibly managed/changed via voting</p>
          <p>⁃ Referral programs and interface</p>
          <p>⁃ Optional integrated KYC module for LPs (Synaps)</p>
          <p>⁃ Optional integrated fiat on/off ramp for LPs (Chatex)</p>
          <p>⁃ Option to immediate listing of tokens on DEXes, lending protocols and info resources</p>
